Fundamental playing mistakes guitar video

For you guys, mainly autodidacts. There are a myriad of things we can do wrong on the guitar and we need to polish this until we got a shiny finish on our playing. There are things related to the rhythm, sound and many not related to actually playing but behaviour like listening, turning down volume, competing.
