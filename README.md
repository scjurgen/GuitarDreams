Some scripts for videos about playing mistakes and habits for guitar players
Fundamental playing mistakes guitar video

For you guys, mainly autodidacts. There are a myriad of things we can do wrong on the guitar and we need to polish this until we got a shiny finish on our playing. There are things related to the rhythm, sound and many not related to actually playing but behaviour like listening, turning down volume, competing.


#Playing Mistakes

##Pressing to hard
out of tune, to sharp

##Pressing to soft
buzzing), 

##Pressing at wrong position (not near the fret)

##Using the wrong plek technique (making noise, flageoletts), 

##Too much movement in left hand

##Incorrect damping

##Overbending and underbending

##Unclean transition

##Playing with too many effects while practising

#General Behaviour

##Playing while others talk, present, do

##Not turning down the volume

##Not listening to yourself

##Not listening to others

#Jam sessions and improvisation:

##Playing without grooving

##Limiting chords to the essential when playing with others

If you play with many others you need to give room to the other instruments playing. You are not that special and everything should be in function of making music, not exhibiting the big ego.
You can limit chords by not playing roots, fifth. 

##Playing with too many effects while practising
as with limiting chords to the essential, the same rule applies to playing with effects. The more effect the more chaos

##Playing too fast

##Playing without having fun

##Thinking of competition instead of making music 

##Playing wishy washy

##No ideas: be silent and listen

#Missing skills:

##not tuning by ear

##tuning wrong (by ear, flageolett)

##playing scales and not making music
