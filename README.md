Some scripts for videos about playing mistakes and habits for guitar players
Fundamental playing mistakes guitar video

For you guys, mainly autodidacts. There are a myriad of things we can do wrong on the guitar and we need to polish this until we got a shiny finish on our playing. There are things related to the rhythm, sound and many not related to actually playing but behaviour like listening, turning down volume, competing.


#Playing Mistakes

##Pressing to hard

Pressing to much will produce notes out of tune, they will be to sharp (never flat).

##Pressing to soft
buzzing occurs when you press not hard enough. This may especially happen with chords and runs you don't control very well.


##Pressing at wrong position (not near the fret)
Pressing not near the fret in direction of the ringing string may produce buzzzing sounds.

##Using the wrong plektrum technique

Using the right plektrum and correlated technique is imperative.

A hard plek helps getting strong dynamics but is not so easy to handle.

A soft plektrum will make less noise but dynamics are not that easy to handle.

Pay attention to the position you pick. Near to the bridge results in a crispy tone.

Near to the fretboard is a warmer tone.

### Making noise when using a plektrum

### Making unwanted flageoletts tones


## Too much movement with left hand

You move to much one finger, usually the pinky is like crazy raising or put under your fretboard.

##Incorrect damping

Damping is a subtle technique, very much used for good dynamics and rhythmic play.

###Palm mute

For a good damping you need to put your palm in the right position.

###left hand muting

Left hand muting is much used in funky comps and good bass play.

##Overbending and underbending

Bending, essential for the blues man must be secure. Sing the note you want to reach

##Unclean transition

##Playing with too many effects while practising

#General Behaviour

##Playing while others talk, present, do

##Not turning down the volume

##Not listening to yourself

##Not listening to others

#Jam sessions and improvisation:

##Playing without grooving

##Limiting chords to the essential when playing with others

If you play with many others you need to give room to the other instruments playing. You are not that special and everything should be in function of making music, not exhibiting the big ego.
You can limit chords by not playing roots, fifth. 

##Playing with too many effects while practising
as with limiting chords to the essential, the same rule applies to playing with effects. The more effect the more chaos

##Playing too fast

##Playing without having fun

Making music is about, yeah right, making music. Have fun. Make mistakes and have more fun.

##Thinking of competition instead of making music 

##Playing wishy washy

##No ideas: be silent and listen

#Missing skills

There are skills that are not really essential while playing a song, but however important.
Skills like tuning, melodic memory.

##Not tuning by ear

Try always tuning by ear when playing at home. Use dOpen tunings to train your tuning skills.

###Tuning wrong

By ear you can tune wrongly when using flageoletts. You have to know that the quints and quarts are actually not clean.


##Playing scales and not making music

Yeah, lot pf training, scales up and down. Patterns and more patterns. But is this music or painting by numbers?
