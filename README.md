Some scripts for videos about playing mistakes and habits for guitar players
Fundamental playing mistakes guitar video

For you guys, mainly autodidacts. There are a myriad of things we can do wrong on the
guitar and we need to polish this until we got a shiny finish on our playing.
There are things related to the rhythm, sound and many not related to actually
playing but behaviour like listening, turning down volume, competing.


# Playing Mistakes

#### Pressing to hard

Pressing to much will produce notes out of tune, they will be to sharp (never flat).

#### Pressing to soft
buzzing occurs when you press not hard enough. This may especially happen with
chords and runs you don't control very well.


#### Pressing at wrong position (not near the fret)
Pressing not near the fret in direction of the ringing string may produce buzzzing sounds.

#### Using the wrong plektrum technique

Using the right plektrum and correlated technique is imperative.

A hard plek helps getting strong dynamics but is not so easy to handle.

A soft plektrum will make less noise but dynamics are not that easy to handle.

Pay attention to the position you pick. Near to the bridge results in a crispy tone.

Near to the fretboard is a warmer tone.

##### Making noise when using a plektrum

It is easy to make noise with the plek. using distortion most of the noise get's suppressed,
so practise with a clean sound to get a clean tone.


##### Making unwanted flageoletts tones

Notice when you are creating unwanted overtones. Some of them are not ok in the musical
context. I.e. on a minor chord you create major thirds on the root note. That hurts the ears.


#### Too much movement with left hand

You move to much one finger, usually the pinky is like crazy raising or
put under your fretboard.

#### Incorrect damping

Damping is a subtle technique, very much used for good dynamics and rhythmic play.

##### Palm mute

For a good damping you need to put your palm in the right position.

##### left hand muting

Left hand muting is much used in funky comps and good bass play.

#### Overbending and underbending

Bending, essential for the blues man must be secure. Sing the note you want to reach

#### Unclean transition

# General Behaviour

#### Playing when it is inappropriate
Only play when you are expected to play. It is the most troubling thing
I encounter when guitar players run off into the reals of some excercise while someone
is explaining something.

#### Not turning down the volume
Done playing? Turn down the volume knob. Avoid feedback, avoid noise when you touch
your instrument.

#### Not listening to others

Learn to listen to others, keep calm, concentrate on how they play, how is the phrasing,
what are the notes envolved.
Can you hear if it is a minor, major, diminished stuff?

#### Not listening to yourself
Ever listened to yourself? Do it, listen to what you play. If you can't listen to
yourself then at least record what
you are doing and listen to eat after playing. Are you playing on beat, out of beat.

# Jam sessions and improvisation

#### Playing without grooving

Again, make music, make people dance. It is not about your skills but about making music.
If it is just about your skills
you should become a circus artist.

#### Limiting chords to the essential when playing with others

If you play with many others you need to give room to the other instruments playing.
You are not that special and everything should be in function of making music, not
exhibiting the big ego.
You can limit chords by not playing roots, fifth. 

#### Overusing effects
as with limiting chords to the essential, the same rule applies to playing with effects.
The more effect the more chaos.

#### Playing too fast

Play fast, but not to fast. Playing to fast without being in time is horrible.
And fast is out, make music, don't show off with lightning speed. A little trick:
build into your phrasing some very fast runs, maybe once an evening. People will believe that
you can do it and, more importantly, understand that you don't want to. It's a choice of style.

#### Playing without having fun

Making music is about, yeah right, making music. Have fun. Make mistakes and have more fun.

#### Thinking of competition instead of making music

Like playing fast or extremly witty, making music is not a competition.
It is, drum-roll, tada... about making music.

#### Playing wishy washy

Play firm, clear, don't play unsecure. You want that people hear you.
You have something to say, say it. And remember, people actually don't now what you are going
to play. So, no wrong is possible.

#### No ideas: be silent and listen

If you haven't any idea on what to play, don't play. It is that easy. Stand still,
listen to what is going on, and then, perhaps, you get the flow and can start making music.

#### Sliding down
Try to avoid habits, like sliding down every time you finished a phrase.
It's like the "ehm" when someone talks. Annoying and doesn't serve any real purpose.

#### Breath

Make pauses, you don't need to play all the time. If you have a real nice phrase
then let it stay in the room. Let it live and breath, don't kill it with a new phrase.

#### Give space

Give space to everyone. Enough said. It is your turn.

# Practising habits

#### Don't play to fast
Only raise speed when you are playing clean. Remember to listen to yourself.

#### Use a metronome

Excercise with a metronome, but don't overuse it. Slow songs need a free
interpretation of rhythm. Try to understand how to play before or after the beat.


# Missing skills

There are skills that are not really essential while playing a song, but however important.
Skills like tuning, melodic memory.

#### Not tuning by ear

Try always tuning by ear when playing at home. Use dOpen tunings to train your tuning skills.

#### Tuning wrong

By ear you can tune wrongly when using flageoletts. You have to know that the quints and quarts are actually not clean.


#### Playing scales and not making music

Yeah, lot pf training, scales up and down. Patterns and more patterns. But is this music or painting by numbers?
